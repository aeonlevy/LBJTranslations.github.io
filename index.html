        I am often asked this question. I was in high school when I first started modeling, but both sides of my face were covered in acne; it was so bad I had to stop modeling temporarily. Even after that, I still struggled with my skin problems until I was in my mid-twenties.Â 
When my skin was at its worst, I would try every product that was said to be good for acne. I would use all types of products on my skin, and it would get better for a while, but right after, it would come back even worse. I was always going between happy and sad. Now, looking back, I think several factors caused this: stress from trying to balance my academic and work life or my very unhealthy teenage eating habits. But, at that time, I was so focused on the visible or surface-level issues that I couldn't approach the deeper part of the problem. My skin only improved when I started training. When I started to exercise, I also began paying attention to what I ate. Therefore, my skin started to improve slowly. I understood for the first time that beauty is built on top of health.
