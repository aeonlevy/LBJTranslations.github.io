          I am often asked this question. I was in high school when I first started modeling, but both sides of my face were covered in acne...
          <br><br>
          It was so bad I had to stop modeling temporarily. Even after that, I still struggled with my skin problems until I was in my mid-twenties. When my skin was at its worst, I would try every product that was said to be good for acne. I would use all types of products on my skin, and it would get better for a while, but right after, it would come back even worse. I was always going between happy and sad. Now, looking back, I think several factors caused this: stress from trying to balance my academic and work life or my very unhealthy teenage eating habits. But, at that time, I was so focused on the visible or surface-level issues that I couldn't approach the deeper part of the problem. My skin only improved when I started training. When I started to exercise, I also began paying attention to what I ate. Therefore, my skin started to improve slowly. I understood for the first time that beauty is built on top of health...

        <div class="passage-title">Reasons to Start Talking In English</div>
        <div class="passage-content">
          “How did you start speaking English?” This is my most frequently asked question...
          <br><br>
          Until I was 24, I could only speak the level of English you learn in high school. I liked my English classes while I was a student, and I think I could do it if I broke it down into little pieces, but it didn’t amount to much. At the time, I was thinking about going to an American university after graduating high school, but I think I would’ve had a really hard time if I actually went. When I went to Paris at 19, it took me a long time to comprehend the things people in the office were saying, and I struggled to make friends. On the other hand, I was asked out on dates, and I desperately tried to keep up with the conversation–but in this regard, not being able to communicate was quite romantic (lol). I returned to Japan with a full realization of the inconvenience of not being able to speak English, but even after that, I kept putting off studying it using my busy schedule as an excuse. However, a few years later I spent a month and a half in New York, and the experience there changed my life. I realized what I wanted, and that it would be essential for me to speak English. From then on, I started studying seriously. That was when I was 24.To start, I watched a lot of foreign dramas. Once I understood the story, I turned on the English audio and subtitles, revealing words I didn’t understand. I asked my English-speaking friends to explain them to me. I also pulled out old textbooks to read, and steadily wrote down words in a notebook. By the way, I’m far from perfect. I make mistakes all the time, and I’m still learning (and probably will be forever). Still, when a word I don’t know comes up in conversation, I ask about it immediately. When I have time, I translate English books. I learned by listening and speaking, so I’m particularly bad at reading, writing, and detailed grammar. Even so, I now have a lot of foreign friends, and can have tea for four hours alone with a friend who only speaks English (I did this the other day and felt I’ve grown). People often ask me if it was hard to study, and it was (lol). In fact, it was really hard. But I couldn’t ignore the fact that my options would definitely increase by being able to speak English, plus it was essential for what I wanted to do, so it was worth the effort. Actually, there are many opportunities that I wouldn’t have been able to take, or chances that I would’ve missed out on, if I couldn’t speak English. When trying new things, the difficulty and challenges will pass as part of the process, so I think it’s better to think about where you want to get to by going through it all. There must be a lot of things that make you go, “Now that I think about it, how did I do that?” So rather than thinking about how difficult it is, think about how it’s worth the effort. If you think like that, your opportunities will expand even more.

        <div class="passage-content">
          What’s everyone doing with their clothes these days? To be honest, I almost never have the chance to dress up...
          <br><br>
          and I don’t go out much anymore, so I don’t really care. I was starting to lose interest. In the morning, I open my closet, and choose the same outfit as always. It’s common for me to pick up the same thing I wore yesterday after leaving it there, wear it for a few days and then wash it. However, that feeling is good. When I put it on, I feel the same as when I dressed up nicely. I think I’m doing it for myself, but I also feel like I’m doing it because I want someone to look at me. What I want to say is that you should do it because you like it. Don’t do it for anyone else. Do it for yourself, because when you do it for yourself, the result will be enjoyable. Then you’ll feel happy. Do it because it’s fun. Do it because you like it.

          <img src="" alt="Takashi Murakami and Kyoto">
          <p>Takashi Murakami’s large-scale solo exhibit, the Kyoto Kyocera Art Museum’s biggest success since its opening, is currently underway. Murakami, who studied Japanese painting in university and is greatly influenced by painters from the Edo Period, confronts the city and history of Kyoto in the theme of his exhibition: "Mononoke."  On the surface, Kyoto has an image of glamor and elegance, but there are many “otherworldly” spots whose stories have been passed down since ancient times. From the amazing picture matching that challenged the eccentric artists of the Edo period to Murakami's version of "Heian-kyo" depicting the four gods of Kyoto (Blue Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise). Using Murakami's works as a guide, we will lead you through the profound world of Kyoto!

          <p>Takashi Murakami’s giant sculpture "Flower Parent and Child" appeared in Roppongi Hills during the pandemic, exuding a Buddha-like divinity in a gloomy world. The highlight of this exhibition, "Rakuchu Rakugaizu Byoubu Iwasa Matabei-gai," depicts the Great Buddha Hall of Hokoji Temple, where a wooden, gold-lacquered seated Buddha statue of about 19 meters in height, which was once built by Hideyoshi, was enshrined. The excitement of people at the time when they saw the giant golden Buddha statue, and the feeling of looking up at this statue in the Reiwa era, hasn’t changed. Since 2003, Murakami has collaborated with Louis Vuitton many times, leaving a significant mark on his career as an artist. As a further development in this exhibition, a smiling "Flower Parent and Child" statue appears on top of a Louis Vuitton monogram multicolored trunk. One of the unique attractions of this exhibition is that you can enjoy works born from the "Superflat" concept, which is inspired by traditional Japanese aesthetics, in a Japanese garden in Kyoto.

          <p>The 10 meter tall sculpture is made of cast bronze and covered in gold leaf. It was placed in the garden pond facing the Higashiyama Cube, an annex of the exhibition venue. The Flower Parent and Child stand on a monogram multicolored trunk, which Murakami transformed into a unique piece, making it an even more eye-catching monument.
Murakami Says, "There are so many different works. Too many!"
